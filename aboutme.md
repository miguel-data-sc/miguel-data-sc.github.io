subtitle: How I ended up with a blog on Data Science.
---

I plan to speak here about DL, AI, Machine Learning or, more in general, Data Science. I'm currently living in Spain.

I begin to write this posts in 2017, up to this point my journey in Data Science can be summarized in: 

**Pre-data science background:** 
Studies of Architecture and Urbanism + 14 years of experience in corporate world. 

**Data science background:**
Mostly **[Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/miguelpm)** Also some MOOCs and quite a lot of books but Kaggle has been the environment where I've had most learning and fun by now. You can check out some of my posts, kernels and overall results [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/miguelpm)

Recently I got admitted to Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas' FASTAI international fellowship program that is taking place during fall of 2017. Fastai is a very rich learning environment and I'm grateful for being there. It feels just fair trying to share at least part of my knowledge in published form here.
